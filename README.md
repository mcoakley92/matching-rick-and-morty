# Matching Rick and Morty

Matching pairs game with Rick and Morty theme, with different levels increasing in difficulty, by adding more cards.

## UX 
The game starts off with pairs of cards (for example four pairs or 8 cards) facing down in a randomised grid. The player then choses two cards
to flip over. If the cards match, keep them facing up. If they do not match, flip them back over and try a different pair. Once all pairs have been
matched and flip the right way the game is complete. 


A modal then pops up with the time taken to complete the level, and a button
that allows the player to move to the next level.
